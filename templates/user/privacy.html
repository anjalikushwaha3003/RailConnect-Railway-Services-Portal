                            your personal information. We will tell you what personal information we hold about you and
                            can provide you with a copy of this; 2) To seek rectification of that personal information.
                            Where the personal information we hold about you is inaccurate we will rectify this, upon
                            your request. Note that this right may be limited in terms of the scope of detail that we
                            will or can rectify; 3) To lodge a complaint to us. We will receive and handle your
                            complaints in accordance with best practice and depending upon where you are and whether we
                            are subject to it, any applicable law. 4) If you wish to access any of these rights, we may
                            ask you for additional information to confirm your identity and for security purposes, in
                            particular before disclosing personal information to you. We reserve the right to refuse to
