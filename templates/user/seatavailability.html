  <h4>Train Seat Availability</h4>
  <p>Whenever it’s travel time, everyone seems to go in an overdrive for finding out train seat availability. 
      Well, it’s hardly surprising considering the fact that the majority of the population still prefers to travel by train and Indian Railways 
      throws open its ticket booking service as much as four months before the date of journey. So, to beat the crowds, it’s best
      to book your ticket as early as possible. However, booking tickets in advance is a good option only if you are sure about your travel plans.
      For many travellers, this is often not the case. In such a scenario, it’s a big hassle to wade through large crowds at ticket reservation counters, 
      just for the sake of tracking the status of train enquiry seat availability.</p>

  <h4>How to Check Train Seat Availability</h4>
  <p>Step 1: Enter the source and destination cities.
      Step 2: Enter your journey date or select from the calendar.
      Step 3: Click on “Search Trains”.
      Step 4: You will land on the page where all the trains running between the source and destination station are listed, along with the seat availability.
      Step 5: Click on the specific class of tickets, and you will land a page where the seat availability of the specific class for a week is displayed, along with 
      the fares.</p>

      <h4>Train Seat Availability FAQ</h4>
      <p>Q) How can I check my seat number on the train?</p>
      <p>A: To check information about your seat on the train, you must check the PNR status. This includes the booking status that shows whether your train ticket is confirmed, or it is on the waiting list (WL) or is it under reservation against cancellation (RAC)</p>
      <p>Q) What does current seat availability mean?</p>
      <p>A: Current seat availability is one of the fastest ways to find out the latest booking information and check the availability of seats in real-time. This can be done by entering the From & To Station Name/Code along with travel dates and travel class to know the current Train Seat Availability.</p>
      <p>Q) What are the chances of my ticket getting confirmed?</p>
